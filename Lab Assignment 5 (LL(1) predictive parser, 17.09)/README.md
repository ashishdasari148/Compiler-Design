# LL(1) Predictive Parser

This program takes a grammar as an input, 
- Removes left recursion
- Computes Left-Factored Grammar
- Computes the FIRST and FOLLOW sets of the symbols
- Takes an input (sequence of tokens), and returns whether the given sequence of tokens follow the syntax of grammar or not, if the grammar is valid (not having any empty productions)

## Compilation and Execution

Run the following commands on Terminal/Command Prompt in the assignment directory

### Compilation

For compiling the cpp program:

```bash
flex grammar2.lex
g++ code.cpp
```

> Note: Argument for the flex command is the name of .lex file that generates the lexical analyzer for the given grammar. So before using this program, make sure you have a grammar.txt file defining the grammar and the corresponding .lex file.
> For example, grammar is defined in grammar2.txt and it's corresponding lexical analyzer is generated by grammar2.lex


### Execution
After the executable is generated from the above command. Run this command in the same directory to execute the program

```bash
./a.out grammar2.txt inputfile3.txt
```


## Interacting with the program

> The definition of the grammar should be given in a .txt file and passed as an argument to the executable

The definition of grammar should be in the following format in the .txt file.

    line 1: <number_of_symbols>
        next number_of_symbols lines: <symbol> <1(if terminal)/0(if non-terminal)>
    next line: <number_of_productions>
        next number_of_productions sections:
            <left symbol>
            <number_of_or_parts>
                next number_of_or_parts subsections: 
                    <number_of_symbols_in_this_part>
                    <space separated number_of_symbols_in_this_part symbols>
    (next is optional)
    next line: <number_of_tokens> <start symbol>
    <space separated number_of_tokens tokens>

Points to Note :
- If a new symbol is added to the grammar due to the removal of left recursion then the new symbol is <oldsymbol\>
- If a new symbol is added to the grammar due to left factoring then the new symbol is named as <space\><symbol_id_of_new_symbol\><space\>

To simulate and check if a given input satisfies the syntax of the given language, give the name of the file in the terminal when the program asks. Make sure the file is in the same directory as the executable.

## Example inputs to the program
>After executing these commands, the program asks for the file name as input (to simulate). Four input files are provided in the directory as inputfile1.txt, inputfile2.txt, inputfile3.txt, inputfile4.txt

Input - 1: (Small Grammar and Correct Syntax)

```bash
flex grammar1.lex
g++ code.cpp
./a.out grammar1.txt inputfile1.txt
```

Input - 2: (Small Grammar and Wrong Syntax)

```bash
flex grammar1.lex
g++ code.cpp
./a.out grammar1.txt inputfile2.txt
```
 
Input - 3: (Large Grammar and Wrong Syntax)

```bash
flex grammar2.lex
g++ code.cpp
./a.out grammar2.txt inputfile3.txt
```

Input - 4: (Large Grammar and Correct Syntax)

```bash
flex grammar2.lex
g++ code.cpp
./a.out grammar2.txt inputfile4.txt
```
